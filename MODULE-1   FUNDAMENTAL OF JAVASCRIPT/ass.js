/*Q1 : What is the difference between Java & JavaScript?

Ans: Java and JavaScript are two distinct programming languages, despite their similar names. They have different purposes, syntax, and use cases. Here are some key differences between them:

1. Purpose and Usage:
   - Java: Java is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that's primarily used for building standalone applications, backend server applications, Android apps, and more. It's known for its platform independence, as Java code is compiled into bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
   - JavaScript: JavaScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language that's primarily used for web development. It's used to create dynamic and interactive web pages by running directly in web browsers. JavaScript allows you to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and add interactivity to websites.

2. Syntax and Grammar:
   - Java: Java has a C-like syntax and is statically typed, meaning variable types need to be declared explicitly. It uses a more complex and verbose syntax compared to JavaScript.
   - JavaScript: JavaScript has a syntax that's influenced by C and other languages, but it's not statically typed. Variable types are determined dynamically at runtime. Its syntax is generally more forgiving and concise than Java's.

3. Runtime Environment:
   - Java: Java applications are compiled into bytecode and run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which provides platform independence.
   - JavaScript: JavaScript is interpreted and executed by web browsers directly, without the need for compilation. Modern JavaScript engines have become highly optimized to improve performance.

4. Typing System:
   - Java: Java uses static typing, meaning variable types are explicitly declared and checked at compile time. This can help catch type-related errors early.
   - JavaScript: JavaScript uses dynamic typing, which means variable types are determined at runtime. This allows for more flexible coding but can also lead to unexpected runtime errors.

5. Development Domain:
   - Java: Java is used for a wide range of applications, including web applications (via Java servlets), desktop applications, mobile apps (using Android), server-side applications, and more.
   - JavaScript: JavaScript is primarily used for web development, including creating dynamic website content, handling user interactions, and asynchronous operations like AJAX calls.

6. Frameworks and Libraries:
   - Java: Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for various purposes, such as Spring for backend development and JavaFX for desktop applications.
   - JavaScript: JavaScript has an extensive collection of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which are commonly used for building dynamic and responsive web applications.

In summary, while Java and JavaScript share a similar name, they serve different purposes and are used in different domains of software development. It's important to understand their distinctions to avoid confusion when learning or working with either language.



Q2. What is JavaScript?
Ans:JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted scripting language primarily used for web development. It allows developers to add interactivity, dynamic content, and behavior to websites. JavaScript is executed directly in web browsers, enabling it to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and provide a more engaging and interactive user experience.

Key features and aspects of JavaScript include:

1. Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is mainly used on the client side of web development. It runs in the browser and can be embedded directly within HTML documents.

2. Interactivity: JavaScript enables developers to respond to user actions such as clicks, input, and mouse movements. This interactivity allows for features like dropdown menus, form validation, and animations.

3. DOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of a web page. JavaScript can manipulate the DOM, enabling dynamic changes to elements, content, and styles without requiring a full page reload.

4. Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await. This is crucial for handling tasks that take time, such as fetching data from servers, without blocking the main thread of execution.

5. Event Handling: JavaScript can listen for events triggered by user interactions or other sources, and it can respond with predefined actions.

6. Cross-Browser Compatibility: Modern JavaScript engines are available in most web browsers, ensuring consistent behavior across different platforms and browsers.

7. Libraries and Frameworks: JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify common tasks and provide reusable code. Examples include React, Angular, and Vue.js for building dynamic web applications.

8. Server-Side Usage: While JavaScript is primarily known for client-side scripting, it's also used for server-side programming using technologies like Node.js. This allows developers to use JavaScript for building server applications as well.

9. ECMAScript Standards: JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript specification, which defines the language's syntax, features, and behavior. Different versions of ECMAScript bring new features and improvements to the language.

It's important to note that while JavaScript and Java share a similar name, they are entirely different languages with distinct purposes, syntax, and use cases. JavaScript is the foundation for creating dynamic and interactive web content, making it an essential tool in modern web development.



Q3. What are the data types supported by JavaScript?
JavaScript supports several data types that are used to represent different kinds of values. These data types can be broadly categorized into two groups: primitive data types and reference data types. Here's an overview of the data types supported by JavaScript:

1. Primitive Data Types:
Primitive data types are simple and immutable (cannot be changed after creation) values. They include:

- Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. For example: 42, 3.14.
- String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes. For example: 'Hello', "JavaScript".
- Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.
- Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet.
- Null: Represents an intentional absence of value.
- Symbol: Introduced in ECMAScript 6, symbols are unique and immutable values, often used as property keys in objects.

2. Reference Data Types:
Reference data types are more complex and are stored as references to memory locations. They include:

- Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs where values can be of any data type, including other objects. Objects can be created using object literals ({}), constructors, or classes.
- Array: Represents an ordered list of values, which can be of any data type. Arrays are objects with additional array-specific methods and properties.
- Function: Represents a reusable block of code that can be invoked with arguments. Functions are also objects in JavaScript.
- Date: Represents dates and times, allowing manipulation and formatting of date-related information.
- RegExp: Represents regular expressions, which are used for pattern matching and manipulation of strings.
- Map and Set: Introduced in ECMAScript 6, Map represents a collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any data type, and Set represents a collection of unique values.

JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you create it. The data type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable. Additionally, JavaScript provides various type-checking mechanisms and methods to work with these data types effectively.

/Q4. What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?
Ans:In JavaScript, variable scope refers to where a variable is accessible or visible in a program. JavaScript has two main types of variable scope: global scope and local scope. The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed and modified.

1. Global Scope:
   - Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope.
   - Global variables are accessible from any part of the code, including functions, blocks, and other scopes.
   - Global variables can be accessed and modified from anywhere, which can lead to potential issues if not used carefully.

Example of a global variable:/

var globalVar = 10;

function exampleFunction() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible inside the function
}

console.log(globalVar); // Accessible outside the function

/2. Local Scope (Function Scope and Block Scope):
   - Variables declared inside a function or block have local scope and are only accessible within that function or block.
   - Local variables are not visible from outside the function or block where they are defined.
   - Each function invocation creates a new scope, so variables with the same name can exist independently in different function invocations.

Example of local scope within a function:/

function exampleFunction() {
  var localVar = 20; // Local variable
  console.log(localVar); // Accessible within the function
}

console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined

// Example of local scope within a block (introduced in ECMAScript 6):

if (true) {
  let blockVar = 30; // Local variable with block scope
  console.log(blockVar); // Accessible within the block
}

console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined

/It's important to note that variables declared without the var, let, or const keyword are automatically assigned global scope, regardless of their location in the code. This can lead to unintended global variable creation and potential conflicts.

With the introduction of let and const in ECMAScript 6, the concept of block scope was also introduced. Variables declared with let and const have block scope, meaning they are confined to the nearest pair of curly braces {} (block) where they are defined.

Using proper scoping practices is crucial to avoid variable name clashes, maintain code organization, and reduce unintended side effects in your JavaScript programs.

Q5. What is Callback?
Ans:In JavaScript, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and it is intended to be executed after the completion of a particular task or event. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming to handle operations that may take time to complete, such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or handling user interactions.

Callbacks are an important concept in JavaScript, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations, because they allow you to define what should happen after a certain operation completes without blocking the execution of the rest of your code.

Here's a simple example of how callbacks are used:

/
function fetchData(url, callback) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = "Some fetched data";
    callback(data); // Call the callback function once the data is fetched
  }, 1000);
}

function handleFetchedData(data) {
  console.log("Received data:", data);
}

fetchData("https://example.com/api/data", handleFetchedData);

/
In this example, the `fetchData` function takes a URL and a callback function as arguments. It simulates fetching data asynchronously and then calls the provided callback function once the data is available.

Callbacks can become complex and lead to issues like callback hell or difficulties in handling errors. To mitigate these issues, other patterns like Promises and async/await have been introduced in JavaScript, providing cleaner and more manageable ways to work with asynchronous code./



/
Q6. What is Closure? Give an example.
Ans: 
In JavaScript, a closure is a function that has access to its own scope, as well as to the variables and functions in the outer (enclosing) scope in which it was defined. Closures allow you to maintain data encapsulation and create functions with "private" variables that can be accessed and modified only within that function's scope.

Here's a simple example of a closure in JavaScript:/

function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = "I am from the outer function";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // innerFunction has access to outerVariable
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // This will log "I am from the outer function"

/
In this example, the `outerFunction` defines an inner function called `innerFunction`. The `innerFunction` has access to the `outerVariable` even after the `outerFunction` has finished executing. When `outerFunction` is called and the `closureFunction` is assigned the returned value (which is the `innerFunction`), the `closureFunction` still has access to the `outerVariable` due to closure.

Closures are particularly useful in scenarios like creating private variables and implementing the module pattern, where you can expose certain functionality while keeping other parts of your code hidden and encapsulated.

Here's another example that demonstrates how closures can be used to create private variables:/

function counter() {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment: function() {
      count++;
    },
    get: function() {
      return count;
    }
  };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter.increment();
myCounter.increment();
console.log(myCounter.get()); // This will log 2
/

In this example, the `counter` function returns an object with two methods, `increment` and `get`, which can be used to manipulate and retrieve the private `count` variable. The closure formed by these methods keeps the `count` variable protected from direct access outside the `counter` function./

/*Q7. What is the difference between the operators ‘==‘ & ‘===‘?
Ans: In JavaScript, the operators `==` (loose equality) and `===` (strict equality) are used for comparing values. They differ in how they perform comparisons, considering data types and values.

1. `==` (loose equality):
   The loose equality operator compares values after performing type coercion, which means it tries to convert the operands to the same type before making the comparison. This can sometimes lead to unexpected results because different data types might be considered equal even if they have different underlying values.

   Example:*/
5 == "5"; // true, because "5" is coerced to a number before comparison

/*
2. `===` (strict equality):
   The strict equality operator compares values without type coercion. It checks both the value and the data type of the operands. It only returns `true` if both the value and the data type are the same.

   Example:*/

5 === "5"; // false, because they have different data types

/*
In general, it's considered better practice to use the `===` operator (strict equality) because it ensures a more precise comparison and avoids unexpected type coercion issues. It's less prone to causing unexpected behavior in your code. However, there might be cases where you intentionally want to perform type coercion and use the `==` operator, but those cases are usually rare and specific.

Here's a summary:

- Use `==` when you want to perform type coercion and you're intentionally looking for loose equality.
- Use `===` when you want strict equality and want to avoid type coercion.

In most cases, using `===` for strict equality checking is recommended, as it promotes safer and more predictable code behavior.*/

/*
Q8. What is the difference between null & undefined?
Ans: In JavaScript, both `null` and `undefined` represent the absence of a value, but they are used in slightly different contexts and have different meanings.

1. `undefined`:
   - When a variable is declared but has not been assigned a value, it is automatically initialized with `undefined`.
   - A function that doesn't explicitly return a value will return `undefined` by default.
   - If you try to access an object property or array element that doesn't exist, the result will be `undefined`.

   Example:*/

/*
   let x;
   console.log(x); // Output: undefined

   function doSomething() {}
   console.log(doSomething()); // Output: undefined

   const obj = { prop: "value" };
   console.log(obj.nonExistentProp); // Output: undefined*/

/*
2. `null`:
   - `null` is a deliberate assignment of an empty or non-existent value to a variable or object property.
   - It indicates that a variable or object property explicitly has no value or is intended to be empty.
   - When you want to indicate that something has no value, using `null` can be more meaningful than leaving it as `undefined`.

   Example:*/
let y = null;
console.log(y); // Output: null

const obj = { prop: null };
console.log(obj.prop); // Output: null

/*
In summary:
- `undefined` usually indicates the absence of an initialized value or the result of a missing property or function return value.
- `null` is used when you intentionally want to indicate the absence of a value or set a value to nothing.

It's important to be aware of these differences when handling variables and objects in JavaScript, as understanding when to use each of them can help make your code more readable and less error-prone.*/

/*
Q9. What would be the result of 2+5+”3″?
Ans: In JavaScript, when you perform operations involving different data types, type coercion can occur, which may lead to unexpected results. In the expression `2 + 5 + "3"`, the addition (`+`) operator is used to perform arithmetic addition and string concatenation.

Here's what happens step by step:

1. `2 + 5`: This results in the numeric addition of `2` and `5`, which equals `7`.

2. `7 + "3"`: At this point, the result of the previous operation (`7`) is coerced into a string because one of the operands is a string (`"3"`). The numeric `7` is converted to a string `"7"`.

3. The final result is `"73"`, which is a string concatenation of `"7"` and `"3"`.

So, the result of the expression `2 + 5 + "3"` is `"73"`.*/

/*
Q10. What is the difference between Call & Apply?
Ans: Both the `call()` and `apply()` methods in JavaScript are used to invoke functions, but they differ in how they pass arguments to the function and how they handle the `this` value.

1. `call()` method:
   - The `call()` method is used to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments passed as separate arguments.
   - The first argument of the `call()` method is the value that will be used as the `this` value inside the invoked function. The subsequent arguments are the individual arguments that the function expects.
   - Arguments are passed directly as a comma-separated list.

   Example using `call()`:*/

function greet(message) {
  console.log(message + " " + this.name);
}

const person = { name: "Alice" };
greet.call(person, "Hello"); // Output: Hello Alice

/*
2. `apply()` method:
   - The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it takes arguments as an array or an array-like object.
   - Like `call()`, the first argument is the `this` value, but the second argument is an array or array-like object containing the function's arguments.

   Example using `apply()`:*/

function greet(message) {
  console.log(message + " " + this.name);
}

const person2 = { name: "Bob" };
greet.apply(person2, ["Hi"]); // Output: Hi Bob

/*
In summary:
- Use `call()` when you have a known number of arguments that you want to pass individually.
- Use `apply()` when you have an array or an array-like object containing the arguments.

Modern JavaScript, starting from ES6, provides the `spread operator (...)` that allows you to achieve similar functionality as `apply()` while also providing a more concise and readable syntax:
*/

function greet(message) {
  console.log(message + " " + this.name);
}

const person3 = { name: "Charlie" };
const args = ["Hey"];
greet(...args); // Output: Hey Charlie

/*
In most cases, you might prefer to use the spread operator or `call()` over `apply()` due to their improved syntax and readability.*/
