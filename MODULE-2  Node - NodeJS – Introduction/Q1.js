/*Q1. What is Node.js? Where can you use it?

ans: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser. Node.js enables the development of scalable and high-performance network applications by using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

B) where it is used ?
=> Node.js is commonly used for building web applications, especially those requiring real-time features such as chat applications, online gaming, and collaboration tools. It is also used for server-side development of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and microservices. Additionally, Node.js has found applications in various areas such as IoT (Internet of Things), desktop applications, and even for building tools and utilities.*/
